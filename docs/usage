Database pane:
	-- Enter connection information for the postgis db and virtuoso.
	
Importer pane:
	-- For each dataset enter a SPARQL endpoint URL, a graph URI and a regex (subject regex) that will be used to identify root nodes (features of interest).
	-- Press the "Set" button. 
	-- Press Import and wait until the import is done. 
	
Fuser pane:
	-- Load links file (must be an .nt file in the following format: <nodeA> <any predicate> <nodeB> .).
	-- Score
		-- Select transformation from dropdown.
		-- Set a threshold optionally. The threshold is a limit in meters for the transformations. If the distance between the geometries is greater than the 			   threshold, the score will be zero.
		-- Press 'Score' to score the transformation on the imported links. Links on which the specific transformation may be applied will be coloured magenta. The 			   score for every link will be visible in a list of scores.  
	 	   
	-- Fuse
		-- Select the checkbox if you want the fusion to take place in a separate graph specified in the fused dataset field. Fused geometries and metadata of 			   selected links will be transfered in the separate graph. If the checkbox is left unchecked the transformations will take place in the existing graph A and 			   the metadata of selected links will be transfered in graph A from graph B. 
		-- Select transformation from dropdown.
		-- Select links on which the transformation is to be applied. Select "Select All corresponding links" to choose all the links that scored more than zero. 			   Those are coloured magenta.
		-- Press 'Fuse'. The resulting geometry(-ies) will be added to the 'fused_geometries' table in the postgis db. Geometries and metadata will be imported in the 			   virtuoso graphs accordingly.
